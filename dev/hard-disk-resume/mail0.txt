This patch reduces S3 resume time from 10+ seconds to less than a second
on systems with SATA drives. It does this by making ata port and scsi disk
resume non-blocking.

This is another resend of the patch I send out in early December. I've
addressed all the feedback I received from list members, so all I really
need is a yay or nay from Tejun Huo and James Bottomley (since it touches
both subsystems).

The notes below include the performance results and patch description.

The essential issue behind hard disks' lengthy resume time is the ata port
driver blocking until the ATA port hardware is finished coming online. So
the kernel isn't really doing anything during all those seconds that the
disks are resuming, it's just blocking until the hardware says it's ready
to accept commands. Applying this patch set allows SATA disks to resume
asynchronously without holding up system resume, thus allowing the UI to
come online much more quickly. There may be a short period after resume
where the disks are still spinning up in the background, but it will only
momentarily affect applications using that disk.

The patch set has two parts which apply to ata_port_resume and sd_resume
respectively. Both are required to achieve any real performance benefit,
but they will still function independantly without a performance hit.

ata_port_resume patch (1/2):
sd_resume patch (2/2):

v3: Jan 14, 2014
 [in response to Tejun Huo]
 - respun the ata patch to merge the entire code path into async resume
   i.e. resume, restore, and thaw.
 - re-tested the changes in hibernate to verify there are no issues
 - respun the sd patch to apply clean over 3.13 rc8, no other changes
v2:
 [in response to Oliver Neukum]
 - Added scsi cmd error reporting through the scsi_sense_hdr
 [in response to James Bottomley]
 - unified the sd_resume code path by just making sd_resume async. Thus all
   three resume callbacks: resume, restore, and runtime-resume will use it,
   but there is a performance benefit for resume only.
 [in response to Bartlomiej Zolnierkiewicz]
 - unified the __ata_port_resume_common code path to include an async
   parameter. This way there's no need to re-implement ata_port_request_pm.
