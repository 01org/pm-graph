Known Bugs:

- usb devices aren't recognized properly in the device hierarchy 
  (e.g. host7 expects 3-13:1.0, gets 3-13)
- devices with more than one callback aren't filtered properly in the
  ftrace callbacks list (e.g. 0000:00:1f.2 is in both general and noirq)
- issues running a graph with only dmesg
