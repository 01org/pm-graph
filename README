-- Description --

This tool is designed to assist kernel and OS developers in optimizing
their linux stack's suspend/resume time. Using a kernel image built 
with a few extra options enabled and a small patch to enable ftrace, 
the tool will execute a suspend, and will capture dmesg and ftrace
data until resume is complete. This data is transformed into a set of 
timelines and a callgraph to give a quick and detailed view of which
devices and kernel processes are taking the most time in suspend/resume.

-- Kernel Configuration --

    The following kernel build options are required:
        CONFIG_PM_DEBUG=y
        CONFIG_PM_SLEEP_DEBUG=y

        There is a patch which does this for the ubuntu raring kernel:
        (config/analyze_suspend_kconfig_ubuntu.patch)

    The following additional kernel parameters are required:
        (e.g. in file /etc/default/grub)
        GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="... initcall_debug log_buf_len=16M ..."

	If you're using a kernel older than 3.11-rc2, the following simple
		patch must be applied to enable ftrace data:
        in file: kernel/power/suspend.c
        in function: int suspend_devices_and_enter(suspend_state_t state)
        remove call to "ftrace_stop();"
        remove call to "ftrace_start();"

        There is a patch which does this for kernel v3.8.0:
        (config/enable_ftrace_in_suspendresume.patch)

-- Usage --

1) First configure a kernel using the instructions from the previous
   sections. Then build, install, and boot with it.
2) open up a terminal window and execute the script:
   %> sudo analyze-suspend.py [-f]
3) wait for the system to suspend (system time stops counting at system 
   suspend so you can wait as long as you need). Then press a key to resume.

When the system comes back you'll see the script finishing up and
creating the output files in the test subdir.

It generates output files in subdirectory: suspend-mmddyy-HHMMSS
    HTML output:                    <hostname>_<mode>.html
    raw dmesg output:               <hostname>_<mode>_dmesg.txt
  (with -f option)
    raw ftrace output:              <hostname>_<mode>_ftrace.txt
