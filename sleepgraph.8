.TH SLEEPGRAPH 8
.SH NAME
sleepgraph \- Suspend/Resume timing analysis
.SH SYNOPSIS
.ft B
.B sleepgraph
.RB [ OPTIONS ]
.RB [ COMMAND ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsleepgraph \fP is designed to assist kernel and OS developers
in optimizing their linux stack's suspend/resume time. Using a kernel
image built with a few extra options enabled, the tool will execute a
suspend and capture dmesg and ftrace data until resume is complete.
This data is transformed into a device timeline and an optional
callgraph to give a detailed view of which devices/subsystems are
taking the most time in suspend/resume.
.PP
If no specific command is given, the default behavior is to initiate
a suspend/resume.
.PP
Generates output files in subdirectory: suspend-yymmdd-HHMMSS
   html timeline   :     <hostname>_<mode>.html
   raw dmesg file  :     <hostname>_<mode>_dmesg.txt
   raw ftrace file :     <hostname>_<mode>_ftrace.txt
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-h\fR
Print the help text.
.TP
\fB-v\fR
Print the current tool version.
.TP
\fB-verbose\fR
Print extra information during execution and analysis.
.TP
\fB-config \fIfile\fR
Pull arguments and config options from a file.
.TP
\fB-m \fImode\fR
Mode to initiate for suspend e.g. standby, freeze, mem (default: mem).
.TP
\fB-o \fIsubdir\fR
Override the output subdirectory. Use {date}, {time}, {hostname} for current values.
.sp
e.g. suspend-{hostname}-{date}-{time}
.TP
\fB-rtcwake \fIt\fR
Use rtcwake to autoresume after \fIt\fR seconds (default: wait for user keypress).
.TP
\fB-addlogs\fR
Add the dmesg and ftrace logs to the html output. They will be viewable by
clicking buttons in the timeline.
.TP
\fB-ftrace \fIfile\fR
Create HTML output from an existing ftrace file.
.TP
\fB-dmesg \fIfile\fR
Create HTML output from an existing dmesg file.

.SS "Advanced"
.TP
\fB-cmd \fIstr\fR
Run the timeline over a custom suspend command, e.g. pm-suspend. By default
the tool forces suspend via /sys/power/state.
.TP
\fB-filter \fI"d1,d2,..."\fR
Filter out all but these device callbacks. These strings can be device names
or module names. e.g. 0000:00:02.0, ata5, i915, usb, etc.
.TP
\fB-mindev \fIt\fR
Discard all device callbacks shorter than \fIt\fR milliseconds (default: 0.0).
This reduces the html file size as there can be many tiny callbacks which are barely
visible. The value is a float: e.g. 0.001 represents 1 us.
.TP
\fB-proc\fR
Add usermode process info into the timeline (default: disabled).
.TP
\fB-dev\fR
Add kernel source calls and threads to the timeline (default: disabled).
.TP
\fB-x2\fR
Run two suspend/resumes back to back (default: disabled).
.TP
\fB-x2delay \fIt\fR
Include \fIt\fR ms delay between multiple test runs (default: 0 ms).
.TP
\fB-predelay \fIt\fR
Include \fIt\fR ms delay before 1st suspend (default: 0 ms).
.TP
\fB-postdelay \fIt\fR
Include \fIt\fR ms delay after last resume (default: 0 ms).
.TP
\fB-multi \fIn d\fR
Execute \fIn\fR consecutive tests at \fId\fR seconds intervals. The outputs will
be created in a new subdirectory with a summary page.

.SS "Ftrace Debug"
.TP
\fB-f\fR
Use ftrace to create device callgraphs (default: disabled). This can produce
very large outputs, i.e. 10MB - 100MB.
.TP
\fB-maxdepth \fIlevel\fR
limit the callgraph trace depth to \fIlevel\fR (default: 0=all). This is
the best way to limit the output size when using callgraphs via -f.
.TP
\fB-expandcg\fR
pre-expand the callgraph data in the html output (default: disabled)
.TP
\fB-fadd \fIfile\fR
Add functions to be graphed in the timeline from a list in a text file
.TP
\fB-mincg \fIt\fR
Discard all callgraphs shorter than \fIt\fR milliseconds (default: 0.0).
This reduces the html file size as there can be many tiny callgraphs
which are barely visible in the timeline.
The value is a float: e.g. 0.001 represents 1 us.
.TP
\fB-cgphase \fIp\fR
Only show callgraph data for phase \fIp\fR (e.g. suspend_late).
.TP
\fB-cgtest \fIn\fR
In an x2 run, only show callgraph data for test \fIn\fR (e.g. 0 or 1).
.TP
\fB-timeprec \fIn\fR
Number of significant digits in timestamps (0:S, [3:ms], 6:us).

.SH COMMANDS
.TP
\fB-status\fR
Test to see if the system is able to run this tool.
.TP
\fB-modes\fR
List available suspend modes.
.TP
\fB-summary \fIdir\fR
Create a summary of all tests in this dir as summary.html.
.TP
\fB-fpdt\fR
Print out the contents of the ACPI Firmware Performance Data Table.
.TP
\fB-usbtopo\fR
Print out the current USB topology with power info.
.TP
\fB-usbauto\fR
Enable autosuspend for all connected USB devices.
.TP
\fB-flist\fR
Print the list of ftrace functions currently being captured.
.TP
\fB-flistall\fR
Print all ftrace functions capable of being captured.
